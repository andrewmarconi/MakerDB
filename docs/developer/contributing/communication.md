# Communication

## Getting Help

- **GitHub Issues** - Bug reports and feature requests
- **GitHub Discussions** - Questions and general discussion (if enabled)
- **Pull Request Comments** - Code-specific discussions

## Best Practices

- Search before asking - your question may already be answered
- Be specific and provide context
- Share error messages and logs
- Be patient and respectful
- Help others when you can
